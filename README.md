# PetHaven using Python, Flask and sqlite3.
This [report](PetHaven.Report.pdf) shows the detailed functionality of the project.

Besides topics related to the extraction, update, and insertion of data using queries, implementing the web app requires strong knowledge of <b>HTML, CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, Jinja2, and being familiar with using Shell/Command Prompt.</b> 


Pet Haven of Tampa Area is a fictional all-volunteer non-profit organization that works passionately to find fur-ever homes for stray, abandoned, and neglected pets, giving them a chance at the best life possible.
Our website is used to process adoptions by volunteers/administrators using a database to store, access, and modify data.  The home page allows users to browse available pets, apply for adoption, and track the status of the application by logging in to the account the system automatically creates when the application is received. For volunteers, the website retrieves the information stored in the database in an organized manner and handles the back-end operations by running SQL queries that are triggered in response to the processing of applications.
